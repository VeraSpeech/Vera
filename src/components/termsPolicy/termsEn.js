              can replace professional medical or therapeutic advice. It is
              important that you consult with a licensed speech therapist or
              other qualified healthcare provider for any specific concerns or
              conditions. Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay
              in seeking it because of any conclusions, advice, content or other

              way warrant or represent that the App can diagnose, treat, cure or
              prevent any speech or language disorder or that any conclusions,
              advice, content or other information provided by the App is
              correct, current, accurate, reliable, complete, or fit for any
              medical purposes, and you acknowledge that we have made no such

              The App stores and processes personal data that you have provided
              to us, to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep
              your phone and access to the App secure. We therefore recommend
              that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process
              of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
              official operating system of your device. It could make your phone
              vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your
              phone’s security features and it could mean that the Vera Speech
              App won’t work properly or at all.

            <li>
              By downloading or using the App, you agree to we are only
              responsible for using measures to ensure the security in the
              storage and transmission of data collected through the App, to the
              extent that such measures are reasonable and commercially
              practicable.

              You should be aware that there are certain things that Vera
              Technology Company Limited will not take responsibility for.
              Certain functions of the App will require the App to have an
              active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or
              provided by your mobile network provider, but Vera Technology
              Company Limited cannot take responsibility for the App not working
              at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you
              don’t have any of your data allowance left. If you’re using the
              App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the
              terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will
              still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile
              provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection
              while accessing the App, or other third-party charges. In using
              the App, you’re accepting full responsibility for any such
              charges, including roaming data charges if you use the App outside
              of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning
              off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
              which you’re using the App, you agree that, by downloading or
              using the App, you represent to us without qualification that you
              have received authorisation from the bill payer for using the App.

            <li>

              device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t
              turn it on to avail the Service, Vera Technology Company Limited
              shall accept no responsibility.

              At some point, we may wish to update the App. The App is currently

              (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
              availability of the App to) may change, and you’ll need to
              download the updates if you want to keep using the App. Vera
              Technology Company Limited does not promise that it will always
              update the App so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the
